#### SQl Zoo solutions

### Tips

Read the PostgreSQL docs. They are really good and at the bare minimum, read sections 1-4
and follow along.

<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/tutorial.html>

As you work through the exercises, struggle a little and don't check the answers till you've really tried. You'll gain nothing by copying and pasting! If you do jump to the answers, break the query in small parts to see how it was put together.
